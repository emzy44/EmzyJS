# EmzyJS
A small Javascript library for single-page applications.

EmzyJS was created from a challenge : "quickly write the smallest library possible allowing to create single-page applications". 
As a first version of a non-serious project, the code may not be optimized. 

**This is NOT suitable for production. You should'nt use EmzyJS other from experimentation purposes.**

You can find the documentation inside the Wiki tab.
